# idleMirage
**Core concept built with the help of AI, v0.dev**

idleMirage is an idle clicker framework following the legacy of Mirage Source for aspiring developers or hobbyists to develop their own web game.

idleMirage will include your basic RPG template and features including quests, shops, and leveling up. 

Inspired by the classic web multiplayer games of the 90s and early 00s, idleMirage is here to bring back that magic and nostalgia for people who enjoy playing PBBGs and games like Melvor Idle but want to make their own.

Stay tuned for upcoming updates/features as well as my own personal game using idleMirage in the near future.
